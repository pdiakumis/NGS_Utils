## NGS Utils

![Build](https://github.com/vladsaveliev/NGS_Utils/workflows/CI/badge.svg) [![Anaconda-Server Badge](https://anaconda.org/vladsaveliev/ngs_utils/badges/installer/conda.svg)](https://anaconda.org/vladsaveliev/ngs_utils) [![PyPI version](https://badge.fury.io/py/ngs_utils.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/ngs_utils)

Helper code for [UMCCR](https://github.com/umccr) and [AstraZeneca](https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS) bioinfomatics projects (e.g. [umccrise](https://github.com/umccr/umccrise), [Ovirage](https://github.com/umccr/ovirage), [NGS_Reporting](https://github.com/AstraZeneca-NGS/Clearup)).

Contains only python code without any heavy reference or test data, so supposed to be small and can be used as a lightweight dependency in other projects.
